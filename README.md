I'm William Park, currently a high schooler at Poolesville HS, and I love creating algorithms and programs to solve unique and challenging problems. I usually go by Pilliam Wark, or just Pilliam for short. (Fun fact: there's a [disambiguation page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Park) for William Park on Wikipedia. Gotta stand out somehow! :P) 

If you want to learn more about me, I have a lot more information listed on my [personal website](https://pilliamw.github.io).

You can check out some of the really cool stuff I've worked on below :D
